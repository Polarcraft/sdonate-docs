Actions - Other Games
==========================

Important Notes
-------------------------------------

RCON commands are ran as soon as the buyer purchases the package, for this reason it is recommended that you DO NOT use commands that require the user to be connected to the server, as they will not work if the user is not connected to the game server when they are making a purchase. Test commands using the "Test Server" button to see which commands work. Games using RCON commands also currently only support permenant packages, so packages never expire.

RCON Console Command
