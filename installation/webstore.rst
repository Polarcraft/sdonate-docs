Installation - One-Click Free Hosting
=============================================

SDonate comes with free hosting and setup on our servers so you don't need your own web host. To use this, simply log in using Steam at https://sdonate.com then go to the account page, then scroll down to the "Web Store" section. You must enter the domain name you want into the "Domain" field. The URL to your store will be https://sdonate.com/stores/<yourdomain>, so if I enter my domain as "myamazingdomain", the URL to my store will be https://sdonate.com/stores/myamazingdomain. You must then choose the main currency of your store, people will still be able to pay using their own currencies, but it will be converted to your main currency in your PayPal account, and the prices on your store will be displayed in the main currency. Once you've done this, click the "Activate Web Store" button to create your store. If all goes well, it will come up with a link that you will need to go to to activate your store. Once activated, you can go back to the account page to see the URL to your store.

.. note::
    If you get a blank page or Error 500 when you go to your store, go to https://sdonate.com/stores/<yourdomain>/installation.php to complete installation. For my example I would need to go to https://sdonate.com/stores/myamazingdomain/install.php

That's your web store set up! If you are using SDonate with Minecraft or Garry's Mod servers go to "Installation - Garry's Mod Server" or "Installation - Minecraft Server" to get instructions for installing the SDonate plugin. Otherwise, you can move on to the "Configuration" section.
