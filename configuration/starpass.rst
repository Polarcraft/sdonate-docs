Setting Up StarPass
=============================

.. note::
    StarPass will only be available if your store's main currency is EUR/Euro. Currently, users can only use StarPass by using it to add €3 credit at a time, this is due to limitations with StarPass' API.

If you haven't already, create an account at http://starpass.fr and sign into it. Now, at the left hand side click on "Create a Monetization Component" or "Créer un document".

Scroll down and you will see "StarPass Access Page URL" and "StarPass Monetization Component URL". Copy these values into the corresponding fields on StarPass as shown in the picture below. Enter anything you want in "Test Code"/"Code de test", set "Number of codes"/"Nombre de codes" to 1, and "Validity of Access Code"/"Validité du code d\'accès" to once/1 fois. For "Cost/Profits" or "Coût / Gain" set it to "I would like a payout of"/"Je souhaite un reversement de" €3.00.
