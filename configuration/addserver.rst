Adding a Server
===================

.. note::
    If you are adding a Minecraft or Garry's Mod make sure you have followed the instructions to install the relevant addon.

To add a server, open the SDonate admin dashboard, then go to the "Package Manager", then click the "Add Server" button. Select the game your server is for, then change the following settings:

* **Name** - Enter the name of your server. This will be the name that shows up in your store.

* **Image** - You can optionally upload an image for this server's icon. If you leave this blank the default game image will be used.

* **IP Address** - Enter the IP address of your server. This is the part before the ":", the port is the part after. Do not include the port.

* **Port** - Enter the port of your server.

* **RCON Password (Not required for Garry's Mod or Minecraft servers)** - Enter the RCON password for your server.

* **Enabled** - Check this to enable the server in your store. If this is not checked the server will not show up in your store.
